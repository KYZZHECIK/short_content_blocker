# Short Content Blocker

A simple Firefox extension that blocks youtube shorts and instagram reels. Personal project for keeping myself in check.

---

## TL;DR
This add-on keeps social media usage intentional. In case of Instagram, it allows messaging but blocks other distractions (Reels, Explore, Main feed, etc.) by redirecting to **/direct/inbox**.  

Support for YouTube Shorts is not here yet, but the plan is to simply ban all access to youtube shorts.

## Permissions
- Runs only on `https://*.instagram.com/*`
- No remote servers, no data collection, we might sell your soul to the devil though.


## FAQ

**Does it block everything on Instagram?**  
No. It blocks distracting stuff (Reels/Explore/feed). DMs are allowed, so you can still view posts/reels sent by friends **inside the chat**.

**Why not just stop using Instagram?**  
Personally, that is the end goal with most social media. This extension is just a step towards that.

**Other browsers?**  
This is designed/tested for desktop Firefox. Anything other browser is not tested.
